This course constitutes a comprehensive exploration of the fundamental concepts and algorithms underpinning contemporary artificial intelligence (AI). It entails a rigorous examination of the foundational ideas that have catalyzed the development of pivotal technologies such as game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Central to the pedagogical approach of this course is the integration of hands-on projects designed to provide students with practical exposure to the theoretical underpinnings of graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, machine learning, large language models, and other salient topics within the domains of AI and machine learning. As students incorporate these critical concepts into their Python programming exercises, they simultaneously cultivate a robust understanding of AI principles, thereby acquiring the requisite knowledge and experience to design and engineer their own intelligent systems. At the conclusion of the course, students will have amassed a wealth of experience with machine learning libraries, coupled with a comprehensive understanding of the principles of artificial intelligence, ultimately equipping them with the capacity to design and develop their own intelligent systems.
